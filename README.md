# 100-days-of-code
python projects from angela yu's udemy course.
- there will be a folder for each day of the course, sometimes combining days if the project spans multiple days
- beginning with Day 75, the projects are significantly more complex and will have their own readme within each folder. 
- Some projects will be moved into their own repository if they are large enough to warrant it.
